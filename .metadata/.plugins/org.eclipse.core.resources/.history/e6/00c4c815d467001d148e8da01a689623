Loops in Java
 Java support three type of loops
	1] for loop  {for-each loop, it will be discussed after array topic dicussion}
	2] while loop
	3] do-while loop

1] for loop
	syntax:
	for(declaration;condition;operation)
	{
		statements
	}
	
	declaration : executed only once in the begining
	condition : executed/checked before executed the loop every time
	operation : executed after the loop body is executed
	
2] while loop (entry control loop)
	syntax:
	while(condition)
	{
		statements
	}
	
3] do-while loop (exit control loop)
	syntax:
	do
	{
		statements
	}while(condition);
	
Que: What is the difference between while & do-while loop
	while 		--> while loop body is executed only if condition is true
	do-while 	--> do-while loop body is executed atleast once irrespective of condition
	
while loop is the faster loop, it is prefer when we need to have fast execution
if we are required declare and perform some operation along with checking the conditionthen for loop is preferred
